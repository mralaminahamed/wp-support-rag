"""Structured logging and request correlation.

Provides a JSON log formatter, a one-shot logging configurator, and an ASGI
middleware that assigns a correlation id to every request and binds it to the
log record (architecture §4.3). The correlation id is also returned to callers
via the ``X-Correlation-ID`` response header so a client error can be traced to
its server-side log line.

Secrets never reach the logger: only the fields assembled here are emitted, and
configuration secrets are wrapped in ``SecretStr`` upstream (NFR-SC-1).
