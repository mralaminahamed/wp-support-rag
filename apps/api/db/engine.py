"""Async database engine and session management.

Owns the single pooled SQLAlchemy 2.0 async engine for the process and the
``async_sessionmaker`` built on it. Two access patterns are exposed: an
``async`` generator dependency for FastAPI request handlers
(:func:`get_session`) and an ``async`` context manager for Celery tasks and
scripts (:func:`session_scope`). A connection is never opened or closed per
request; both helpers draw from the pool.
